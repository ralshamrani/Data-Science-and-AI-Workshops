# Data Science and AI Workshops

A curated collection of workshops I’ve designed and presented on **Data Science**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Programming** — built to help learners connect theory with practical, real-world applications.  
Each workshop includes clear explanations, live code examples, and hands-on exercises suitable for both beginners and intermediate learners.

## 🧠 Workshops Included
### 1. **Intro to Data Science**
A foundational introduction to the data science lifecycle — including data collection, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation.

### 2. **From Statistics to AI**
A conceptual and practical journey showing how classical statistics evolved into modern artificial intelligence, with emphasis on data-driven reasoning, predictive modeling, and automation.

### 3. **Data Analysis using R Language**
A practical workshop focused on exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data using the **R programming language**.  
Participants learn how to handle datasets efficiently and communicate insights through statistical and graphical methods.
